            This portfolio demonstrates my abilities to design, build, and deploy interactive online dashboards.
            The dashboards use public APIs to display real-time data
            while following modern web design standards and Continuous Integration/Deployment techniques.

        <h3>Book Explorer Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
            This dashboard enables users to search for books and see their genre distribution.
            It accesses book data from the Google Books API. Users can search for books based on
            their title or author. The results include author information, cover image, and a brief description.
        </p>
        <p>
            The interactive feature allows users to open a new tab with full book data from Google Books by clicking on any book card.
            The dashboard offers a "Load More" option for more results, as well as a pie chart that
            shows the distribution of book categories based on searches.

        <h3>Space Explorer Dashboard</h3>
        <p>
            Dive into the universe with this dashboard, which displays real-time astronomical data.
            The dashboard combines with NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API and Mars Rover Photos API.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day, the Astronomy Picture of the Day section features a new cosmic image or video, 
            accompanied by thorough explanations. Users can view past APOD entries by selecting specific dates.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Mars Rover Photos feature allows viewers to view recent photographs captured by NASA's Mars rovers.
            Users can filter photographs from the Martian surface by selecting different rovers or even specific cameras.
            This offers an intriguing look at humanity's exploration of the Red Planet.
